<!--<p align="justify"><strong>1. Signal Processing:</strong><br/>The department is actively working on Signal modeling, multiresolution/ multiscale signal processing and applications. Wavelet Transform: Design and Applications, Biomedical Signal Processing: ECG and EEG signal processing, Biomedical. Image processing: microscopic image analysis(cancer research), EEG and fMRI signal processing, MRI image processing, Statistical SignalProcessing. There is a major focus is on Hyperspectral Imaging, Collaborative Filtering, Biomedical Signal Processing, Medical Imaging. The main faculty involved in this area are Dr. Anubha Gupta, Dr. Angshul Majumdar, Dr. Pravesh Biyani and Dr. Shobha Sundar Ram.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>2. Circuits & Systems:</strong><br/>This research group works in the broad area of RF Electronics with particular emphasis on RF Measurements, RF and Mixed Signal Electronics, PA Design, Modeling and Linearization. Current research focus is in developing innovative design methodologies for multi-band RF/microwave circuits and systems for enabling optimal SDR applications and 'Green Communications'. In addition, we are also working on innovative solutions for implantable devices and their test & evaluation. Focus is also made on RF Measurements, RF and Mixed Signal Electronics, PA Design, Modeling and Linearization. A major focus is also laid on Analog Mixed signal circuit design with Emerging  and CMOS Technologies Transparent and flexible Large-area electronics, Device modeling and Devices, Nanoelectronics, Energy-efficient systems, CAD for VLSI. The main faculty involved in this area are Dr. M.S. Hashmi, Dr. Pydi Ganga Bahubalindruni, Dr. Sneh Saurabh and Dr. Sujay Deb.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>3. Wireless Communication & System:</strong><br/>The main area of research here is 4G Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) which is an enhancement of LTE which provides high peak data rates, flexible spectrum operations, improved system capacity, large coverage and is compatible with existing systems. Although, it inherits all features of LTE, its own unique features are carrier aggregation, device-to-device communication, advanced antenna techniques, heterogeneous networks (HetNets), etc. Further, 4.5G LTE-A pro and 5G aim to increase the capacity many times, support massive connections with large coverage, provide ultra-reliable and low-latency communications, enhance user experience, and improve various efficiency metrics (e.g., spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency). The main faculty involved in this area are Dr. Vivek Ashok Bohra, Dr. Anand Srivastava, Dr. Sanjit Krishnan Kaul and Dr. Sumit J Darak.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>4. Controls & Robotics:</strong><br/>Collaborative robotics laboratory (Coral) focuses on designing novel algorithms for multiple robotic vehicles working cooperatively with a human operator to achieve various tasks. Currently, we are targeting our methodologies towards environmental monitoring and wildlife. Dr. P.B. Sujit is majorly involved in this area. </p> -->
