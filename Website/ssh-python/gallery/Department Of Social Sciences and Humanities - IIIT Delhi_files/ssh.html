We will analyse the way in which the market system functions as a mechanism for coordinating the independent choices of individual economic agents. The course will develop a basis for evaluating the efficiency and equity implications of competition and other market structures, and a perspective on the appropriate role of government. Included areas are the study of consumer choice, production and cost theory, market structure, and market failure. Students will develop their understanding of economic models specified in standard mathematical terms. Towards the end of the course, students will be able to assess the real microeconomic situations using the tools learnt in the course.</p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">ECO201 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=ECO201">Macroeconomics </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">This course will introduce basic models of macroeconomics along with real-world examples from various industrialized and developing economies. It will provide a unified framework to analyze aggregate behavior of agents in an economy using aggregate demand and supply analysis. We will study the impact of monetary policy and fiscal policy options on economic growth, labor market wages, income distribution, exchange rates, etc. in the short-run, medium-run, and long-run. </p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">ECO311 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=ECO311">Game Theory </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">Game Theory is a fundamental analytical tool in Economics alongwith Price Theory. Game theoretic modeling and strategic analysis as a distinct methodology has been a major intellectual achievement of the past century not only within the Economics discipline but more broadly in the Social Sciences. The course requires and further develops conceptual thinking as well as problem solving abilities of students. </p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">ECO313 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=ECO313">Market Design </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">The theory of auctions and matching have been one of the most important successes of applied game theory. Auctions have become a central institution for resource allocation in real world markets; instrumental in allocating resources as varied as natural resources, spectrum rights, electricity generating capacity and more. Matching algorithms play a central role in allocation of discrete resources. This course aims to prepare the students to be able to analyze auctions and matching markets using tools from economics and game theory. </p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">ECO321 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=ECO321">Econometrics I </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">We will review working with expectation operators and matrix algebra. We will study various statistical models utlizied to test theoretical economic relationships, analyze historical economic events, and conduct economic policy evaluation. Simple and multiple regression using ordinary least squares estimation, maximum likelihood estimation, and general;ized least squares estimation will be covered in detail. We will learn tools of basic statistical inference and diagnostics for these models.

Because of its importance, finance should be widely and thoroughly understood. The field is complex and it undergoes constant change due to shift in economic conditions. All of this makes finance stimulating and exciting, but challenging and sometimes perplexing. This course aims at creating a better understanding of the financial system.</p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">PSY201 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=PSY201">Introduction to Psychology    </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">This course is about how and why people think, feel and behave. Students will learn and apply theories of self, mind, and behavior. This course is an experiential course. Students will learn to think more critically and scientifically about what makes people think, feel, and behave. This course offers students an engaging introduction to the essential topics in psychology. Throughout this study of human behavior and the mind, students will gain insight into the history of the field of psychology, as well as explore current theories and issues in areas such as cognition, motivation, and wellness. The main goals of this course are to acquaint students with different areas contained within psychology, to provide them with some of the major concepts of each area. Basic topics that would be covered would be historical and contemporary psychology, including various perspectives: biological, Psychoanalytic (Freudian),  behavioral (Skinner, Pavlov, and other theories), humanistic, Jungian, cognitive, Transactional analysis. Some practical topics like Memory, Personality, cognition, Motivation, mindfulness, Cognitive behavior therapy and basics of positive psychology would also be covered. Students will also learn the concepts of Intelligence. Computational Psychology, Computational Neuroscience and Technological research in interventions would also be explored.   </p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">PSY202 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=PSY202">Positive Psychology  </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">"Happiness is not an end state, but rather something you work towards your whole life. Thus, you can be happier each day. Even happiness is a journey, not a destination."<b>- Martin Seligman</b>

<br><br>In this course students will not only study but actually imbibe this journey. 

<br><br>The mentioned course would be based on the key concepts of Positive Psychology, its principles, concepts and experiential practices. The course focuses on the psychological aspects of a fulfilling and flourishing life. Topics include happiness, self-esteem, empathy, friendship, love, achievement, creativity, optimism, conflict resolution, gratitude, positive leadership, hypnosis, mindfulness, meditation and humor.

<br><br>Positive psychology is "the scientific study of optimal human functioning" and was first introduced as a field of study by Dr. Martin Seligman in 1998, when he was President of the American Psychological Association. 

<br><br>The underlying premise of positive psychology is that you can learn to be happier just as you can learn a foreign language or to be proficient at golf. This rapidly growing field is shedding light on what makes us happy, the pursuit of happiness, and how we can lead more fulfilling, satisfying lives. As Martin Seligman states that it is the Science of Positive Psychology that would help the individual to study the self and the society and to help him realize his maximum potential, with which he would be able to lead a happier personal, academic, social and professional life.
<br><br>This course is designed to explore the concepts, research behind the concepts, techniques, factors and exercises to enhance optimism, decrease stressors, and significantly increase wellbeing. The format of the course will be experiential, workshop based and interactive along with assigned lectures and readings to create an environment conducive to learning new concepts, skills and applications.

Particularly we will explore the basic mental processes such as how our brains let us "view" and "understand" the world, how our perceptions depend on our current state of attention, and how our memories and perceptions can change over time with our own experiences. In this process of better understanding the human mind, we'll discuss language abilities and the mental representation of concepts and schemas. We'll also look at various actions that people take in different situations-from simple visual illusions, to strategic higher order decisions to grave mistakes in higher-level decision-making. In this context we will discuss how these "successes" and "failures" provide unique insights into the mechanisms of human thinking.

It will focus on some foundational sociological/ Anthropological concepts such as social structure, environment, social organization, social institutions, social role, social relations, social change and social problems. All these key terms would be examined with reference to modern social theories and methods, which barely 200 years ago, helped shape sociology and anthropology as unique human disciplines. Historically, both these disciplines were distinct from the earlier disciplines of economics, philosophy and psychology because they directly confronted data from social life and collective social processes in the 'field', in order to critically analyze, and discover patterns and meanings in them. The enormous diversity of people around the globe could thus be organized conceptually and theoretically through statistical surveys, questionnaires and interviews, not only to make sense of the basic oneness of humanity but also to shape policies and programmes to help improve the fast deteriorating social conditions under modern urban and industrialised ways of life. The irreducible subject matter and unit of study for sociology and anthropology therefore was neither the abstract atomized individual nor the crowd but the empirical relationship between the individual and his/her social context which had to be unearthed and examined afresh by the scholar without getting misled by more obvious, subjective explanations. Students of the course will be led through a variety of experiences of observable social phenomena such as caste, class, gender, race, sexuality, religion, globalization, poverty, crime, work and many such others, in order to arrive at the basic scientific principles of society.</p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">SOC204 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=SOC204">Sociology of New Media </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">This course is aimed introducing students to macro-sociological concepts to understand the role of new media and online networking in the contemporary world. (In PART I) we draw from sociological perspectives that move beyond 'Technological Determinism' and shed light on the social and real-world implications of IT-driven media and communications. <br> We begin with a survey of key concepts, including the theories of networks by Barry Wellman (2012), Manuel Castells (1996) and others who conceptualized the rise of 'new' media and online communications as as central to ongoing social change. (In Part II) We consider a series of thematic areas and evaluate these theories in the context of contemporary societies. These themes range from the rising inequality and digital divide, to the role of new media in politics and power and also in the related fields of journalism and law. In terms of pedagogical approach, and evaluating criteria, our course will rely on active learning that requires all students to participate and engage with online communities as well as reflect on the key concepts through their own experience as social media users in India.</p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">SOC205 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=SOC205">Anthropology of Social Media   </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">When we hear the words 'social media' we immediately think of Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. But these are just platforms. Actually, Social media is the vast amount of content we have produced and its consequences for our lives. The content we produce are not just memes and Selfies alone, but they are also tools for making and breaking relationships, a means for creating equality and/or reinforcing inequality. While there have been grand claims made about how social media has impacted the lives of people around the world, we often fail to ask is it really likely that social media has changed the life of a low-income builder in Brazil in exactly the same way as it has for an IT professional in South India or that of a factory worker in China? Consider this claim... social media is a sort of big brother that knows all our intimate details and we have lost our rights to privacy. While it is true for some, it is equally true that social media is also the first-time people experience privacy. For e.g. In China, for some people far from being a threat to their privacy, social media was actually the very first time they had experienced what we would call individual privacy. This was true in Turkey as well. Similarly, while it is true that while some might view social media as a distraction to education, it is equally true that for a few others social media is itself education. Likewise, for some the Selfie is more about expressing friendship rather than individual glamour, thus subverting the notion of individualism. How do we know this? Why do people see the same phenomenon differently? While it is important to understand 'what' content we produce, the question of why we produce such content is equally significant. This course meant as an introductory course is about People and an attempt at understanding and uncovering subtle texts for breakthrough insights.   This course invites you to come and see for yourselves what people around the world do with social media.</p><br></td></tr></tbody> <tbody class="courselist">  <tr><td><span class="number">SOC206 : <a class="number" href="https://iiitd.ac.in/courserepo/course-full-description.php?course_number=SOC206">Business Anthropology </a></span> (Credits: 4)  </td></tr><tr> <td> <p align="justify">How did experiences of sleeping in strangers' homes lead to the creation of one of the world's most successful online hospitality company - Airbnb? How did the idea of public space influence and lead to the creation of the world's most successful coffee company - Starbucks? How does Youtube, the most significant pool of social and cultural data since the beginning of recorded communication use it to reveal more about us, humans and the society we live?<br>
Why do people buy what they buy? Do Malls have a hold on the consumers? Does Coca-Cola have the same meaning in all cultures?  How does advertising influence your decision to buy? Do people buy products which speak to their cultural values? How is culture tied to consumption? How do companies mine your social media and online data for understanding your consumption patterns?<br>
Does Wall Street have its own culture? How does working in virtual teams affect the work culture and productivity of people? How do employees make use of organizational technology to shape Organizational culture? Does the idea of 'Tribal Leadership' by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh influence employees?<br>
All the above factors have cultural influences more than what we tend to acknowledge. In the recent past corporations have started using ethnography and anthropology to gain insights into marketing and organizations strategically. Exploring and deconstructing such cultural and social influences through both  fieldwork and case studies (text and videos) with a sprinkling of anthropological theories is the primary intent of this course.
