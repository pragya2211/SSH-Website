<p align="justify">Monika Gupta is a Researcher in the Cognitive Tech Support team, IBM Research, New Delhi. Her research interests include process mining, software engineering, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications. She is currently pursuing Ph.D. degree with Prof. Jalote and Dr. Alexander Serebrenik, TU/e, The Netherlands. She was a recipient of the Prime Minister's Research Fellowship from 2013 to 2017. She has written many peer-reviewed conferences and journal and also has the Best Poster Award in the Gracehopper Conference India 2016. During her PhD, she interned at Infosys Research Labs, Eindhoven University of Technology - The Netherlands, and IBM Research Bangalore. She was awarded Microsoft travel grant, ACM travel grant, IARCS travel grant and GHCI scholarship. </p>
<p align="justify">She will give a 20 minute talk on her joint work with Infosys, published in Empirical Software Engineering journal. After that, she will be happy to answer questions regarding internships, IBM hiring process and research industry after PhD. So it can be of interest to wider audience.</p>

<p>Abstract of the talk is:</p>

<p align="justify">Management and maintenance of IT infrastructure resources such as hardware, software and network is an integral part of software development and maintenance projects. Service management ensures that the tickets submitted by users, i.e. software developers, are serviced within the agreed resolution times. Failure to meet those times induces penalty on the service provider. To prevent a spurious penalty on the service provider, non-working hours such as waiting for user inputs are not included in the measured resolution time, that is, a service level clock pauses its timing. Nevertheless, the user interactions slow down the resolution process, that is, add to user experienced resolution time and degrade user experience. Therefore, this work is motivated by the need to analyze and reduce user input requests in tickets' life cycle. </p>

<p align="justify">To address this problem, we analyze user input requests and investigate their impact on user experienced resolution time. We distinguish between input requests of two types: real, seeking information from the user to process the ticket and tactical, when no information is asked but the user input request is raised merely to pause the service level clock. Next, we propose a system that preempts a user at the time of ticket submission to provide additional information that the analyst, a person responsible for servicing the ticket, is likely to ask, thus reducing real user input requests. Further, we propose a detection system to identify tactical user input requests. To evaluate the approach, we conducted a case study in a large global IT company. </p>

<p align="justify">NOTE: Post-talk, you can ask questions related to internships, IBM hiring process, and research industry after PhD.</p>
